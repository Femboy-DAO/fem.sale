      <h2>DAO Lore</h2>
      <p>
        FemboyDAO started in January 2022, with the goal of creating a community for crypto femboy enthusiasts and launching femboy-themed crypto projects,
        starting with a crowdfunded NFT collection.
      </p>
      <h3>The Crowdfund</h3>
      <p>
        In April 2022, the DAO crowdfunded 71.2 ETH to support the launch of the NFT collection and future projects.
        Shortly afterwards, a collection of 9 active and responsible looking DAO members formed a council, which is taking charge of the DAO's goals.
      </p>
      <h3>Main NFT Collection</h3>
      <p>
        Work on the main collection started in July 2022 after the council found a worthy artist to draw it: Nekobox. 
        This collection is still in development, so check again later. 
      </p>
      <h3>Scuffed Femboys</h3>
      <p>
        Somewhere along the way we wanted to expand our technical capabilities when it came to actually making the main NFT collection,
        then the placeholder developer art got a bit out of hand, and a small collection of scuffed femboys was the result.
